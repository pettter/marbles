Week 6

Topic title: A prototype of the Tree Automata Workbench MARBLES

Much of the early week was spent on general design principles, and getting
a proper 'feel' for the scope of the project. The typing system proposed in
the paper was found to be insufficient, so alternatives were investigated.
In the end, it was decided that a further investigation into the various
constructs that need to be represented was required.

In general, it was thought that most of the class AUT (i.e. various
algorithms handling automata) could be seen as generalised tree
transducers, with grammars going from the empty tree to a class of trees,
and automata going from a tree to the tree itself, or to the empty tree (if
the tree is rejected).

A general pattern of these transducers would be some kind of tree walker,
combined with a 'visitor', which together would walk all over the input
tree, computing the output tree.
