Week 7

Unfortunately, not a very productive week. Quite a few articles were
skimmed or read, in search of a suitable superclass for tree transducers
and automata, but it is not clear if anything was found. Multi-return macro
tree transducers (possibly with attributes) seem like the best bet for now,
but a more general approach (with both top-down and bottom-up as special
cases) would be preferrable.

Brink has an idea about modelling transducers/automata as a tree-walker and
some kind of patterns applied at each step. To me, it feels as if it could
be too general, in some sense, but I am unsure.

This week will hopefully include some actual program design and setup of
the development environment.
