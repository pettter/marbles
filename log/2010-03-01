Week 8 - Learning Scala

Scala indeed seems like an ideal language for the task, with many many
abstractions useful in the project. The plan for now is to use Scala
internally, and expose java interfaces to be implemented in client code.

Extractor/injector patterns is a good example of a nice, usable construct,
as are case classes, traits and the multiple inheritance given by same.

Plans for next week is to implement a few basic classes, such as trees,
automata etc. in Scala, both to get a better feel for the language and
because those constructs will surely be needed.
