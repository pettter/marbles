Week 10

Last week was hot and unproductive. Basic automata were implemented in
Scala, which is very suited for that kind of thing. In principle, the
ruleset can be directly written as a Scala PartialFunction, but some
alternative representation should probably be used to ease introspection of
formal devices.

This week will focus on more implementation and design issues. A general
implementation of automata and transducers will be a priority, as well as
some algorithms working on same.
