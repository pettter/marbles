Week 11 - Diversion

I diverted some time into reading up on various nondeterministic learning
methods related to the MAT model, due to a possible article being written
by Brink and Jacu. Also, the representations are in many parts based on
linear algebra techniques, which will be useful in any efficient
implementation in Marbles.

At the moment, I am stuck trying to understand multilinear functions in an
intuitive way, which to me is very hard. Hopefully, I will be able to
understand it somewhat during the beginning of next week, and could
potentially get something done before leaving for Sweden.
