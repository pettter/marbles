Week ??

Kept reading up on various automata formalisms. Restricting the weighted
variants to fields makes computation simpler, especially when using
nondeterminism. However, this excludes the Boolean case, opting instead for
the field of two elements (xor automata) in order to get an additive
inverse of 1/true.

Whether the Boolean semiring is an interesting field of study is a
different question, but for many operations on deterministic automata (e.g.
union, intersection etc.), building the standard nondeterministic
automaton is much simpler than moving to the field of two elements. A
reasonable approach is to extend residual finite-state automata for strings
to the case of trees, using trees and contexts instead of pre- and suffixes
in the standard way.

However, as I am in Sweden, this week will see a bit of focus on finishing
the actual specification and project plan, as well as getting something to
show for the Marbles implementation.
