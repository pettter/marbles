Sweden week

Resulted in a specification for the project, and a few attended seminars.
Also some reading, and a clarification of the actual goals of the project.
Further time was spent on finding an article on residual finite tree
automata, as well as realising that no article has been written on the
learning of same, although the scientific contribution of such an algorithm
is questionable, unless a great increase in efficiency is observed.

More implementation needed. Will try to get something doe after arrival in
SA.
