Last week was spent implementing and refining transducer splitting. For
now, implementation efforts will focus on finishing regular tree
grammars/automata as examples of the generator/recogniser groups of tree
automata. After that, parsers and graphical components will begin to be
included, probably similarily as to how Treebag is constructed.

After parsing is complete for the basic components, weights will be
introduced properly.
