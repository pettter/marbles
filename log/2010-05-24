Automata/regognisers are complete, while grammars have been put on hold for
a time, seeing how they are more difficult to view as 'functions'. Parsing
has been looked at as well, and determined to be more complex than a casual
glance would indicate. Specifically, inheritance of 'static' methods such
as parse(String/Stream) is not really possible in Scala. Instead, the
companion object is used.

Some theory and reading is required before starting off. Some was done last
week, the rest will be done this week, whereafter, again, parsing will be
the focus.
