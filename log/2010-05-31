Last week was spent on trying to get the parsing to work, but no such luck.
Various approaches were tried, but none seemed to fit nicely into the
combinator parser framework already in place. Alternatively, the approach
fit into the framework, but was unusable or faulty in some other way. I
will continue trying to get something working out of it, in the worst case
I will have to write it all myself, but that should hopefully not be
necessary.
