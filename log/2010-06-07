Last week was spent keeping at the parsing problem, and finally, a solution
was found by using the outer 'ElementParsers' class for basically shipping
around the inner 'Parser' class, and using an implicit conversion to get
the ElementParsers to each and every different internal Parser.

After that, most of the time was spent implementing various parsers. At the
moment, the most glaring omissions are a) grammars and b) weights. Also,
some time has been spent on trying to comment at least the general outline
of the code.

The issue at hand is to keep creating parsers, and also creating a useable
system for weighted automata and the handling of those.
