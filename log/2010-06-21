Mostly, this week was spent implementing weighted automata. Surprisingly,
this went rather well, with both bottom-up and top-down automata completed,
as well as a number of different semirings. Some difficulties were
encountered with regards to how the result of a weighted automaton should
be computed, but careful thought and consideration resulted in an algorithm
which should be correct.

In general, much of the complexities stems from the fact that as much of
the code as possible is written in a functional style, as many of the
algorithms in literature are not described as such.
