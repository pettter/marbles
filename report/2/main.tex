\section{A generic framwork for TA programming}

\subsection{Previous work}

Software for working with trees and tree automata has mostly been written
on a case-by-case basis, e.g. as a toolkit for working on XML data, or
for applying Expectation-Minimisation training to tree transducers.



Treefire, Tiburon, Treebag, various others.

All relatively special-purpose. Treebag sort of general on level of
languages, but unsophisticated.

\subsection{A unified framework - MARBLES}

Refer to MARBLES paper, paraphrase.

Contained in the thesis - a prototype, various ideas for future work,
nothing that is likely to remain.
