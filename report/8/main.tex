\section{Future work}

\subsection{Code refactoring}

It has to be noted that the code is far from complete, even as a base, and
it is likely that a complete rewrite using the lessons learned in the
programming of this prototype would make enough of an improvement to
motivate it. In the absence of this, a refactoring should be made, with
considerable effort spent on getting the type and trait hierarchies right.

\subsection{Java interface}

The first step to improve the usability and applicability of the code is
probably to complete the java interface. This will allow far more potential
users to leverage the code already written, while likely not introducing
much problems with existing code. Further, this will serve to make the
actual programming constructs

\subsection{GUI}

Adding the graphical component is likely one of the larger pieces of work
that remains. This will require another refactoring, or at least parallell
implementation, of many core types and traits, notably to allow for partial
computations and intermediate results to be displayed in some reasonable
fashion.
