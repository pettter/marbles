Format of report

Introduction to subject

  * Theory of tree languages, specifically grammatical inference
  * Situation in usable software (refer to Marbles paper)
  * Areas of use

Introduction to problem

  * Grammatical inference of tree languages is hard but possible
  * Software for working with tree languages and tree automata is
    special-purpose
  * Little work done in performance of various inference algorithms

What is treebag?

  * Software for working with trees and operations on trees
  * Can generate and transform trees in various ways, as well as interpret
    them using various algebras
  * Written by Frank Drewes in Java	

What will Marbles be?

  * Software for working with tree automata and operations on tree
    automata, as well as on trees
  * Closer to a general-purpose library than treebag
  * More advanced typing than Java can supply would be useful

What the project consisted of

  * Grandiose plans for large prototype including GUI and Java interface
    with reflection etc. etc.
  * A comparative study of various grammatical inference algorithms and how
    they perform on various languages

Method adopted

  * Read up on what should be included and what should not.
  * Decide on a reasonable language to use
  * Start designing a reasonable architecture
  * Implement a 'large enough' subset to start experiments
  * Implement various learning algorithms
  * Experiment on algorithms

Problems encountered

(hoo boy, where to start...)

  * In general, things took longer than expected
  * In addition, motivation was lacking at times
  * Further troubles included
  	* Several weeks of learning Scala, including choosing the right version
	  to use
	* Picking apart complex typing bugs, ending up suggesting (and getting
	  through) an admittedly minor change to the standard Scala library
	* Understanding the combinator parser library of Scala, and extending
	  it to work as intended for the purposes of the project
	* Translating the usual imperative algortihms of various articles into
	  somewhat functional equivalents

Resulting code

  * 2kloc of mostly basic stuff

How the code can be used

  * The current code is definietly usable as a base for further work.
  * 

Comparison of learning algos...

  * Has not been done

Conclusions

  * 

Future work

  * Oh dear god so much :((
