\section{Project goals}

The goal of the project was to arrive at a reasonable proposition for the
MARBLES framework general architecture, to serve as a beginning for
further discussions and research. More specifically, the goals for the
general architecture included

\begin{itemize}
\item Generality, as in, able to accomodate both weighted and unweighted
automata, trees, transducers and algebras, as well as other variations of
same;
\item Simplicity, as in, having only prior knowledge of standard Java
programming, and some Tree Automata concepts, one should be able to use and
preferrably extend the framework;
\item Intuitivity, as in, placement and naming of methods and classes
should be relatively self-explanatory, and do/be what the name implies and
nothing else.
\end{itemize}

Further, the project aimed to provide a basic GUI for interacting with the
framework on a symbolic level, as well as a number of java interfaces to
allow for plug-in code to be written in any JVM language.

A more detailed project plan can be found in Appendix %TODO
