\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Potential use}

Obviously, it is not viable to use the current codebase in all the cases
where the finished product will fit in. However, there are still places
where the code may be useful. If nothing else, as a generalised way of
parsing and using trees and tree automata in Scala.

\subsection{Lessons learned}

%Although it has been said since time immemorial, and will be repeated long
%after this thesis has been lost and forgotten, it is worth noting that
%things often take a lot more time than originally estimated.
%
%Also, some way of keeping motivation at a sufficient level is required for
%results to materialise, for example peer pressure, reasonable deadlines
%etc.
%
%In addition, 
The Scala language is in many senses ideal for this project, but has some
interesting quirks which leads to interesting bugs at times, and
frustration at others. Frequently, the typing system proved both a
stringent way of checking the logic of the intended algorithms, and a
source of complex and hard-to-track-down bugs.

\textbf{TODO:} Much text on the lessons learned regarding the architecture
and choice of various types etc etc
