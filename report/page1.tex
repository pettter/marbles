\begin{abstract}
In \cite{drewes_marbles}, Drewes outlines Marbles, a programming framework
for working in a generic and systematic way, not only on trees, as several
frameworks already exist for this purpose, but on tree recognisers,
transducers, generators and other formal devices as well (collectively:
tree automata). This thesis focuses on a proposed implementation of this
framework, with special focus on the choice of language and ease of
extension.
