\section{Results}

While the codebase introduced in Section \ref{sec_method} is potentially
sufficient to express the automata types themselves, the goal of Marbles is
to do algorithms on the automata, not just use them in calculations as-is.
The fact that implementation of automata closely resembles the theoretical
bases lends credence that this would, in fact, be possible, if not easy. It
may be in order, once again, to
