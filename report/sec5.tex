\section{Conclusions and future work}


Future work: make trees and automata not parameterised in the type of the
alphabet, but rather in the actual \emph{alphabet}. Need to check if this
is reasonable/possible, specifically if type checking is based on object
identity or equality. Probably impossible due to type erasure...
