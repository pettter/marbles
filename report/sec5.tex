\section{Conclusions and future work}


Future work: make trees and automata not parameterised in the type of the
alphabet, but rather in the actual \emph{alphabet}. Need to check if this
is reasonable/possible, specifically if type checking is based on object
identity or equality. Probably impossible due to type erasure...

Future work: Other automata types (should mention in report?) MTT,
       attributed TT, CFTG, rewrite systems (L-systems?)

Future work: is deterministic a subtype? a property? both? not a trait at
least

Future work: Parameterise classes on state type, makes composition much
simpler.
